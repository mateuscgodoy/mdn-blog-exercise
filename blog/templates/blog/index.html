<h1>Blog Fiesta</h1>
<p>This simple application was created as a practice using Django to set a web application.</p>
<p>Therefore it's fairly simple with small number of features.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Users can read blog posts;</li>
    <li>Registered users may write new
        ones or comment on them.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's pretty much it for now. Hope you like it and thank you for checking it out! ðŸ¥³</p>
